Fourth Pull Request Notes
10/17/2018

I started by creating a "helper" class called VMUtility that has specific methods designed return a list of each of 
the individual contents of the vending machine (Coins and drinks remaining in the vending machine or sent to the
delivery chute). This simplifies a lot of the methods needed to be called in the actual tests, and also helps me on
an organizational level. Since this is part of the test project this class will also be used for other test classes.

Then I created a new test class with starting with two tests using assert statements and to test 
correctness (as suggested). For this test class, I created two methods with assert statements to check correctness.
One regarding the vending machine's output (change, soda), and another checking the remaining contents inside the 
vending machine.

The first unit test checks if the correct approximate change is delivered (not enough coins in the vending machine
for exact change) as well as the drink. It also checks the remaining contents in the vending machines (coins, drinks).

The second unit test checks for the same output but expectss the correct exact change is delivered as the vending machine
now has enough coins.

Took this week to start getting using to C# again. First created a new unit test project in visual studio.
The first group of unit tests will deal with creating and configuring the vending machine.
The testing class has been named "BadSetup". Began with writing two simple unit tests regarding the vending machine.
The first unit test checks if an invalid drink cost is caught by the exception handler.
The second unit test checks if the number of drink names and costs are equal to the number of selection buttons/soda can racks.

Second Pull Request Notes

Since I know how to use C# and this is a past assignment, going over this codebase isn't something new to me. 
However, there are many classes and it is difficult to understand every component of the entire system.
The assignment was given to us expecting us to be able to program the vending machine logic without understanding
the whole system. I will begin looking over the system and see if any changes are needed to
improve testability. I will also start writing unit tests in order to check if the vending machine logic is working
and if the vending machine contents are correct, as well as if appropriate exceptions are thrown.
