Third Pull Request Notes
10/10/2018
Took this week to start getting using to C# again. First created a new unit test project in visual studio.
The first group of unit tests will deal with creating and configuring the vending machine.
The testing class has been named "BadSetup". Began with writing two simple unit tests regarding the vending machine.
The first unit test checks if an invalid drink cost is caught by the exception handler.
The second unit test checks if the number of drink names and costs are equal to the number of selection buttons/soda can racks.

Second Pull Request Notes
10/3/2018

Since I know how to use C# and this is a past assignment, going over this codebase isn't something new to me. 
However, there are many classes and it is difficult to understand every component of the entire system.
The assignment was given to us expecting us to be able to program the vending machine logic without understanding
the whole system. I will begin looking over the system and see if any changes are needed to
improve testability. I will also start writing unit tests in order to check if the vending machine logic is working
and if the vending machine contents are correct, as well as if appropriate exceptions are thrown.
