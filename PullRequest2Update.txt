Second Pull Request Notes

Since I know how to use C# and this is a past assignment, going over this codebase isn't something new to me. 
However, there are many classes and it is difficult to understand every component of the entire system.
The assignment was given to us expecting us to be able to program the vending machine logic without understanding
the whole system. I will begin looking over the system and see if any changes are needed to
improve testability. I will also start writing unit tests in order to check if the vending machine logic is working
and if the vending machine contents are correct, as well as if appropriate exceptions are thrown.
